# Eight Sleep Control App

This WebApp is an alternative interface to control any Eight Sleep mattress. It gives the user the ability to schedule the temperature throughout the night without the need for an Eight Sleep subscription. This is achieved by not using Eight Sleep's "Smart Scheduling" feature, but instead running a recurring script every 30 minutes to adjust the temperature based on the schedule.
